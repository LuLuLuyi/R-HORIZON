For example, \\(81\\) is \\(13\\text-\\textit{eautiful}\\) because \\(81  = \\underline{6} \\ \\underline{3}_{13} \\) and \\(6 + 3 =  \\sqrt{81}\\). Find the least integer \\(b\\ge 2\\) for which there are more than ten \\(b\\text-\\textit{eautiful}\\) integers.\n\nNote: In this problem set:\n- [variablek] represents the calculated variable needed to solve problem k.\n- [answerk] represents the answer to problem k.\n\nSolve all problems step by step and provide the answers for all problems in the following format:\n\n### Final Answers\n\nProblem 1: \\boxed{[answer1]}\n\nProblem 2: \\boxed{[answer2]}\n",
